## 👤 User-Tracker

This script allows you to quickly identify tokens containing a link redirecting to specific users you have selected, such as Elon Musk. 🚀

When a token contains a link to a tweet or a post from a user you follow, certain visual elements, like the feather 🪶 and/or the Internet icon 🌐, are automatically highlighted in a different color (red) to help you quickly identify tokens that might be of interest.

For example, in the video, you can see that the feather appears in red because the token contains a link to a tweet from an account you're tracking.

➡️ No user limit — follow as many users as you want.  
➡️ Import the Twitter accounts you follow into Twitter Tracker on User Tracker.  
➡️ Export the accounts you follow on User Tracker to share them with your friends.

## 🌈 Tweet Date Colorizer

This script automatically colorizes tweet dates on Axiom Trade for easy spotting! 🎯

🟢 If the tweet is less than an hour old, it appears in green (editable).  
🔴 If the tweet is more than an hour old, it appears in red.

For example, in the images, you can see that in the first image, the date is in green because the tweet is less than an hour old. In the second image, the date is in red because the tweet is more than an hour old, which often indicates that the hype has already passed.
